# Takeaways

----

- what can people expect to walk away with?
- What is TidyTuesday and how does it work? Connecting it to R for folks that are unfamiliar?
- What are the essential features of alt-texts
- Why they shouldn't just repeat what's in the title or caption (in some documents, those thext elements will already be accessible, and they are not adequate to understand what the results.

???

name: motivation
class: highlight-last-item <!--css class that makes the "current" bullet point bold and the previous points gray-->

# Motivation

- What's this talk about? What motivated the topic?

- What a screen reader is, and what it does and doesn't do (e.g. it reads static text on the screen, not graphics or text in videos (like Zoom screen-sharing).
- While some OSs and platforms (FaceBook, LinkedIn) have AI image recognition, it is not capable of describing data visualizations.
- Why do blind people need data visualizatioN? Current examples like Covid incidence maps (public health), election maps, and because blind researchers are out here crunching data, reading the literature, and sharing findings.
- R does not have the capability of producing readable charts, like SAS and Andy Stefik's program.

name: TidyTuesday

# What is TidyTuesday

- What is TidyTuesday and how does it work? 
- Connecting it to R for folks that are unfamiliar.

- Development of learning communities like R4DS (https://www.rfordatasci.com -- ugh! a bunch of the first links on this page are unlabeled)

---
name: analysisDataCollection

# TidyTuesday data collection

- How is TidyTuesday data collected? 

---
name: analysisAltText

# Alt text scraping

- How was alt text scraped from the images?

???

---
name: analysisResults

# What we found

- What results did we find? This will be a few slides probably.

- Overall and annual numbers of TidyTuesday Tweets
- Overall and annual percentages of TidyTuesday Tweets containing alt-text at all
- From my point of view: how many of these alt-texts don't actually tell me what the data are showing analysis according to rubric?

???

---
name: otherPlaces

# Where else does this show up?

- Online R books made available digitally to people with print disabilities  
- R package documentation (e.g. gtsummary::tbl_summary has example output with no description)
- Blogs
- This shows up at the individual-level and at the corporate-level (e.g. RStudio)

???

---
name: shiftingTide

# Has the tide started shifting?

- Where are conversations about this happening
  - Within R: useR!2021, MiR
  - More broadly: Data Visualization Society, a11y Meetups
- What changes have we seen generally (e.g. new alt text code chunk option for R Markdown)?
- What changes have we noticed since announcing our talk?
- Changes are just starting and slow

???
Caveats relating to required behavioral changes. For example: The alt-text thing for R Markdown is great, *but*  people will probably have to interrupt their workflow to describe what the data show after creating the graphic! If you want reproducible reports, you will still have to go back in and explain what the data show. This is why people are going to be tempted to put just the title-caption there and leave out the most crucial information.

# How to write good alt text for a data visualization

- How exactly do you write good alt text for a data visualization? The rubric!
- Do you have enough information to understand the purpose of the image without seeing it?

# Where can people learn more?

What's the call to action? And where can people learn more (e.g. a short curated list resources)?
