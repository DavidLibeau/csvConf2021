Question #14 on the submission form is about diversity and accessibility:
> CSVConf is committed to providing a welcoming community for all participants. One of our priorities is to increase and retain the diversity of speakers. Therefore, we strongly encourage talks from underrepresented genders, people of color, people who are LGBTQ, people with disabilities or any other underrepresented minorities in the data community.

## Submission ideas

Liz proposed these ideas
* Of X tweeted TidyTuesday entries, y% had alt text.
* The median alt-text word count was Z. We suggest that a minimum of K words is necessary to describe a plot. (So we don't get "Cool Plot").
* B% of the alt text was functionally equivalent to the title of the plot (a frequent mistake)
* C% of the alt text was functionally equivalent to the caption of the plot
